Free Online C/C++ Tutorials and Documentation

eels) Looking for free online C++ tutorials? Or free online C tutorials? (Or other such free online

documentation on C/C++?) This page contains some links to free electronic documentation,
guides, tutorials, references, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), books (ebooks) on C, C++ and
the Standard Template Library (STL). The various free documentation often come either as
browsable web based HTML documents, PDF files (which can be read using any of the freely
available PDF viewers), or PS (PostScript) files. While some must be read online, others allow you

eure to download a set to your computer for offline reading.

Note that not all of the online tutorials are error-free, and many are incomplete. In general, if you
need a reliable guide to C/C++ that has been peer-reviewed and edited, it is best to buy a good
book on the language. Some books on C/C++ are listed on the

page. Of course if you just want to take a look at what the language is like, these online
guides allow you to take a free look without having to buy a book.

I'm glad to see that setjmp() and longjmp() are still allowed.
I'm just kidding by the way. For those C programmers who haven't encountered these before, it is a powerful way to do a ""goto"" in C.
Powerful in the sense that you can jump anywhere, not limited to the same function. If it's used at all these days, it's used for
exception handling.

The way | see the list is that it isn't meant to be exhaustive, it's meant to be functions that contributors are likely to try to use. A
new contributor might not realize that they should be using Git's internal strbufh instead of the libc string functions. It's a way
to give them feedback on that from their compiler, before they spend more time on the patch and send it to the mailing list.

‘Also seems mostly for functions which look innocent and are likely to be used but are very easy to misuse.

setimp/longjmp is not in this category, it might be argued to be easy to misuse but doesn't look innocent and is not likely
to be used in normal codebases.

C Language Quirks
Background

During the years, I've had the privilege to work with prototypes
of processors still under development that sometimes existed only
in a handful of copies in the world. My task has been to port
operating systems to these new processors. Similar the processors,
the accompanying tools were also early beta versions. As with most
beta software, the compilers I used were somewhat buggy and they
required a quite deep knowledge about the C language in order to
debug issues introduced by incorrect compilations.

Learning the ins and outs of the C language was something I
really enjoyed and at the time I knew more or less the entire C
language standard with all its weird behavior that are pretty
unknown to most regular developers. In this article I'll try to
describe some of the more interesting things I learned over the
years.

Shift Operator Oddities

Many developers interested in the details of the C language
know that shift operators don’t always have an intuitive behavior.
For example, shifting down a negative number may on some targets
be a division while it isn't a division on others. This is called
undefined behavior and the result of the operation depends on
whether the CPU fills the high bits with the sign bit or not. Basically

Chapter 4. Bluetooth programming in C with BlueZ

There are reasons to prefer developing Bluetooth applications in C instead of in a high level language such as Python. The
Python environment might not be available or might not fit on the target device; strict application requirements on program
size, speed, and memory usage may preclude the use of an interpreted language like Python; the programmer may desire
finer control over the local Bluetooth adapter than PyBluez provides; or the project may be to create a shared library for
other applications to link against instead of a standalone application. As of this writing, BlueZ is a powerful Bluetooth
communications stack with extensive APIs that allows a user to fully exploit all local Bluetooth resources, but it has no
official documentation. Furthermore, there is very little unofficial documentation as well. Novice developers requesting
documentation on the official mailing lists [1] are typically rebuffed and told to figure out the API by reading through the
BlueZ source code. This is a time consuming process that can only reveal small pieces of information at a time, and is quite
often enough of an obstacle to deter many potential developers.

This chapter presents a short introduction to developing Bluetooth applications in C with BlueZ. The tasks covered in
chapter 2 are now explained in greater detail here for C programmers.

4.1. Choosing a communication partner

A simple program that detects nearby Bluetooth devices is shown in Example 4-1. The program reserves system Bluetooth
resources, scans for nearby Bluetooth devices, and then looks up the user friendly name for each detected device. A more
detailed explanation of the data structures and functions used follows.

Example 4-1. simplescan.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <unistd.h>

C Programming on the Raspberry Pi

Introduction

| blogged on programming Fortran a few articles ago, this was really a tangent. | installed the Coder:Blocks IDE to do
‘some C programming, but when I saw the Fortran support | took a bit of a side trip. In this article I want to get back to C
programming on the Raspberry Pi. I've been a C programmer for much of my professional career starting at DREA and
then later on various flavouts of Unix at Epic Data and then doing Windows programming at a number of companies
including Computer Associates/Accpac Intemational/Sage. I've done a lot of programming in the object oriented
extensions to C including C++, Java, C# and Objective-C. But | think at heart | still have a soft spot for C and enjoy the
fun things you can do with pointers. | think there ate a lot of productivity benefits to languages like Java and C# which
take away the most dangerous features of C (like memory pointers and memory allocation/deallocation), | stil find C to
be vety efficient and often a quick way to get things done. Admittedly I do all my programming these days in Python, but
sometimes Python is frustratingly slow and then | miss C.

In this article we'll re-implement in C our flashing LED program that | introduced here. We've now run the same program
in Python, Scratch, Fortran and C. The Raspberry Pi is a great leaming environment. If you want to leam programming

Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3/E (CS:APP3e)
Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron, Carnegie Mellon University

Legacy site for the second edition

CONTACTS REQUESTDESK COPY
(Overview. This book (CS:APP3e) Is the third edition of a book that stems from the introductory computer
systems course we developed at Carnegie Mellon University, starting in the Fall of 1998, called
""Introduction to Computer Systems"" (ICS). The presentation is based on the following principles, which
aim to help the students become better programmers and to help prepare them for upper-level systems

‘+ Students should be introduced to computer systems from the perspective of a programmer, rather
from the more traditional perspective of a system implementer. What does this mean?

‘+ Students should get a view of the complete system, comprising the hardware, operating system,
compiler, and network

‘+ Students leam best by developing and evaluating real programs that run on real machines.

We cover data representations, machine level representations of C programs, processor architecture,
program optimizations, the memory hierarchy, linking, exceptional control flow (exceptions, interrupts,
processes, and Unix signals), virtual memory and memory management, system-level /O, basic network
programming, and concurrent programming. These concepts are supported by series of fun and hands-on
lab assignments. See the manuscript Preface for more details.

Web asides. We had so much material for this book that we couldn't fit it all in! Instead, we have created
electronic documents containing useful additional material, which we call Web asides. Check it out. You'll
find interesting theoretical and practical information that goes beyond the scope of the book

Course Materials for Instructors and Students. The Student Site contains additional material for the
students. The Instructor Site contains a complete tumkey solution for teaching the course.

Well-behaved alias commands on Windows
if February 08, 2021

Since its inception I’ve faced a dilemma with w64devkit, my all-in-one Mingw-w64
toolchain and development environment distribution for Windows. A major goal of the
project is no installation: unzip anywhere and it’s ready to go as-is. However, full
functionality requires alias commands, particularly for BusyBox applets, and the usual
solutions are neither available nor viable. It seemed that an installer was needed to
assemble this last puzzle piece. This past weekend | finally discovered a tidy and
complete solution that solves this problem for good.

This article is intended to help C & C++ programmers understand the essentials of what the linker does. I've explained this
to a number of colleagues over the years, so I decided it was time to write it down so that it's more widely available (and so
that I don't have to explain it again). [Updated March 2009 to include more information on the pecularities of linking on
Windows, plus some clarification on the one definition rule.]

A typical example of what triggers this explanation is when I help someone who has a link error like:

gt -o test testla.o testib.o
testla.o(.text+0x18): In function ‘main’:

: undefined reference to findmax(int, int)’
collect2: 1d returned 1 exit status

 

If your reaction to this is ‘almost certainly missing exter *c""' then you probably already know everything in this article.

What are deterministic builds?

A deterministic build is a process of building the same source code with the
same build environment and build instructions producing the same binary i

Rui Ueyama — December 2015

Iwrote a self-hosting C compiler which I named 8cc in 40 days. This is a log when I
was writing it from scratch by myself in 2012. The code and its history are available
at GitHub.

Day 8&

So I'm writing a compiler. It started working after writing about 1,000 lines of code.

Here are some examples of code that work with the compiler:

int a= 1;
at+2; // =>3

int a = 61;
int *b = & a;
*b; // => 61

Arrays are correctly decayed into pointers, so the code like this works too. It also

supports function calls.

char *c = “ab"" + 1;
printf(""%c"", *c); // => b

Implementing these features is easy because this is the second time for me. I've
gotten better at handling pointers and arrays.

Memory

The machine layout that I describe is that of the machines in the hydra lab. If you try to go through the programs in this
lecture on other machines (e.g. kenner, the hydra machines), you will likely get different results. However, you should be
able to figure out how whatever the machine you are on is laid out.

Also, you should set up your shell so that you don't generate core files when doing this lecture. Ie., if it is not done in your
.eshre file, do:

UNIX> Limit coredumpsize 0

 

This lecture is an introduction to memory as we see it in Unix.

As Ihave said previously, memory is like a huge array with (say) Oxffffffff elements. A pointer in C is an index to this array.
Thus when a C pointer is Oxefffe034, it points to the Oxefffe035th element in the memory array (memory being indexed
starting with zero).

Unfortunately, you cannot access all elements of memory. One example that we have seen a lot is element 0. If you try to
dereference a pointer with a value of 0, you will get a segmentation violation. This is Unix's way of telling you that that
memory location is illegal.

For example, the following code will generate a segmentation violation:

main()
{

char *s;
char c;

(char *) 0;
#5;

c

}
As it turns out, there are 4 regions of memory that are legal. They are:

Compiling C code for MIPS and running it on x86

So you want to compile a piece of C code for your MIPS64-based computer
architectures lab? In that case you're in need of a cross-compiler toolchain ' 7. On
your PC you probably have Intel's 32-bit processor, which is commonly abbrevated
as x86 or it's 64-bit counterpart amd64. On your Ubuntu box you may run apt-get
install gcc but as you've probably already guessed - it produces binaries which are
compatible with x86 or amd64 architectures.

Your router probably runs MIPS32 architecure based processor and for that you
need what is called a cross-compiler toolchain. Creating such toolchain is a tedious
task because you need to compile bunch of tools: GCC capable of producing
binaries for MIPS, binutils to compile assembly code and link MIPS binaries, GNU C
Library for MIPS and many more.

The easy way out is to use OpenWrt and let it compile the toolchain for you.
OpenWrt is a commonly used software for routers. First make sure you have all the
bells and whistles installed on your Ubuntu box:

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev gawk flex build-essential ¢
You can start off by checking out the Git repository of OpenWrt:

git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git

DOOMS SOURCE CODE REVIEW: INTRODUCTION (PART 1 OF 6) >>

On November 23, 2011 id Software maintained the tradition and released the
source code of their previous engine. This time is was the turn of idTech4 which
powered Prey, Quake 4 and of course Doom 3. Within hours the GitHub
repository was forked more than 400 times and people started to look at the
game intemal mechanisms/port the engine on other platforms. | also jumped on
it and promptly completed the Mac OS X Intel version which John Carmack
kindly advertised

 

In terms of clarity and comments this is the best code release from id Software
after Doom iPhone codebase (which is more recent and hence better commented). | highly recommend everybody to read,
build and experiment with it

Here are my notes regarding what | understood. As usual | have cleaned them up: | hope it will save someone a few hours and
| also hope it will motivate some of us to read more code and become better programmers

P99 - Preprocessor macros and functions for C99 and C11

P99 is a suite of macro and function definitions that ease programming in modern C, aka C99. By using new facilities in C99 we implement
default arguments for functions, scope bound resource management, transparent allocation and initialization, ...

By using special features of some compilers and operating systems, we also are able to provide an almost feature complete emulation of the
new C standard, C11.

Macros and inline functions working together

In C, functions (whether inline or not) and macros fulfill different purposes. Their difference should not be seen as ideological as some seem
to take it, and what is even more important, they may work nicely together.

Macros are text replacement that is done at compile time and they can do things like P99_SIGNED(EXPR) which is defined by P99. That
macro takes an expression as an argument, and tells at compile time of whether or not the integral type of EXPR is signed or not. Additionally
it guarantees that EXPR itself is not evaluated at run time (so there are no side effects), but that only its type is taken into consideration.

Such an example shows that macros are ideally used when the type of an expression is to be determined and you want to act accordingly to
that type. On the other hand, the pitfall with macros is that their arguments may be evaluated several times, which is bad because of side
effects.

Functions on the other hand are typed, which makes them more strict or, phrased negatively, less flexible. Consider the function

intine
wintmax t p0® abs signed(intmax_t a) {
return (a < 6) ?-(uintmax_t)a-: (uintmax_t)a;

It takes signed integer value a and computes its absolute value. Observe that the return type of this function is unsigned. This has to be so,
since otherwise not all valid values could be realized.

p00_abs_signed would not be a good candidate for a macro, since ais evaluated twice in the expression; once in the controlling expression
and once for returning its value or its negation.

Why const Doesn't Make C Code Faster

‘Translations:12Z,

Ina post a few months back I said
. I figured I should explain that one, especially because I used to believe it was obviously true, myself. I'll start off
with some theory and artificial examples, then I’ll do some experiments and benchmarks on a real codebase: Sqlite.

A simple test

Let’s start with what I used to think was the simplest and most obvious example of how const can make C code faster.
First, let’s say we have these two function declarations:

Build Your Own Text Editor

Welcome! This is an instruction booklet that shows you how to build a text editor in C.

The text editor is antirez’s kilo, with some changes. It’s about 1000 lines of C ina
single file with no dependencies, and it implements all the basic features you expect in
a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a search feature.

This booklet walks you through building the editor in 184 steps. Each step, you'll add,
change, or remove a few lines of code. Most steps, you'll be able to observe the
changes you made by compiling and running the program immediately afterwards.

I explain each step along the way, sometimes in a lot of detail. Feel free to skim or skip
the prose, as the main point of this is that you are going to build a text editor from
scratch! Anything you learn along the way is bonus, and there’s plenty to learn just
from typing in the changes to the code and observing the results.

See the appendices for more information on the tutorial itself (including what to do if
you get stuck, and where to get help).

If you're ready to begin, then go to chapter 1!

Hi people!

This patch series introduces a port of GCC to eBPF, which is a virtual
machine that resides in the Linux kernel. Initially intended for
user-level packet capture and filtering, eBPF is nowadays generalized
to serve as a general-purpose infrastructure also for non-networking
purposes

The binutils support is already upstream. See

How to destroy Lin

n not the right language for web development

The ugliest C feature: <tgmath.h>

osted on December 8, nie,

<tgmath .h> is a header provided by the standard C library, introduced in C99 to allow easier
porting of Fortran numerical software to C.

Fortran, unlike C, provides “intrinsic functions”, which are a part of the language and behave
more like operators. While ordinary (“external”) functions behave similarly to C functions,
with respect to types (the types of arguments and parameters must match and the restult type
is fixed), intrinsic functions accept arguments of several types and their return type may
depend on the type of their arguments. For example Fortran 77 provides, among others, an
INT function which accepts Integer, Real, Double or Complex arguments and always returns

Displaying a List with SwiftUI
from a remote JSON file

@ Roberto Breve Oct 8,2019 - 2min read * aon

The purpose of this tutorial is to show a simple way to fetch data from a
remote JSON file and display it on a List in SwiftUI. Apple has a tutorial
with a local file, also this one teaches you how to do this, however I want to

show a simpler way using a newer version of Xcode 11.0 (11A420a).
Apple beta libraries are getting constantly changed before releasing the
final versions, so older tutorials might not work on the latest versions of

XCode

Supposing we have this JSON file, that show an array of movie titles.

Encoding and Decoding Custom Types

Make your data types encodable and decodable for On This Page
compatibility with external representations such as JSON. Overview ©

Overview

Many programming tasks involve sending data over a network
connection, saving data to disk, or submitting data to APIs and
services. These tasks often require data to be encoded and
decoded to and from an intermediate format while the data is being
transferred,

The Swift standard library defines a standardized approach to data
encoding and decoding. You adopt this approach by implementing
the Encodable and Decodab1e protocols on your custom types.
Adopting these protocols lets implementations of the Encoder
and Decoder protocols take your data and encode or decode it to
and from an external representation such as JSON or property list.
To support both encoding and decoding, declare conformance to
Codable, which combines the Encodable and Decodable
protocols. This process is known as making your types codable.

Building Lists and Navigation

With the basic landmark detail view set up, you need to
provide a way for users to see the full list of landmarks, and
to view the details about each location.

You'll create views that can show information about any
landmark, and dynamically generate a scrolling list thata
user can tap to see a detail view for a landmark. To fine-
tune the UI, you'll use Xcode's canvas to render multiple
previews at different device sizes.

How To Efficiently Display Large

This tutorial will demonstrate how to handle and display thousands of points

of data on an iOS map in a way people understand and enjoy.

We are going to make an iOS app which ships with 87,000 hotels, each with a
coordinate, a name and a phone number. This app will never ask the user to
“redo search in area’; it will update the map as the user pans and zooms,

allowing the user to freely explore the data.

This will require us to come up with an ultra quick data structure built for the

task. We will need to build it in C for it to be performant. Once we have

JULY 24, 2019

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a kind of neural network that specialize in processing
sequences. They're often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks because of
their effectiveness in handling text. In this post, we'll explore what RNNs are,
understand how they work, and build a real one from scratch (using only
numpy) in Python.

This post assumes a basic knowledge of neural networks. My introduction to
Neural Networks covers everything you'll need to know, so I'd recommend reading that first.

Technology that publishers and advertisers use to make
advertising even more relevant to people is now being used far
beyond its original design intent - to a point where some data
practices don't match up to user expectations for privacy. Recently,
some other browsers have attempted to address this problem, but
without an agreed upon set of standards, attempts to improve user
privacy are having unintended consequences.

First, large scale blocking of cookies undermine peoples privacy by
encouraging opaque techniques such as fingerprinting. With

How Tinder keeps your exact
location (a bit) private

You and your good buddy, Steve Steveington, are the co-founders and co-CEOs of an
online tracking company. You started the company less than a year ago in order to
commercialize a WhatsApp metadata leak that you discovered. You could both sorely
use some co-leadership training, but you've still managed to grow the company into a
powerful and precariously employed team of 65 assorted interns, work experience
kids, Task Rabbits and unpaid trial workers. You recently moved into an exquisite new
office in the 19th Century Literature section of the San Francisco Public Library, and
your reputation in the online marketing sector is flourishing.

But beneath this glossy and disreputable exterior lies turmoil. You suspect that Steve
Steveington, your good buddy, co-founder and co-CEO, is plotting against you. He
keeps darting out of the library at odd times, for hours on end. When you ask him
where he’s going he makes a weird grimace that he probably thinks is a malevolent
smile and tells you not to worry. You’ve ordered the librarians to tail him several times,
but they are all terrible at fieldcraft.

You've lived in Silicon Valley for long enough to know the kind of cutthroat villainy that
goes on when large sums of money and user data are at stake. Steve Steveington is
probably trying to convince your investors to squeeze you out. You think that Peter
Thiel will back you up, but aren't so sure about Aunt Martha. You have to find out

Pedometers in general

Common electronic pedometers (eg. activity trackers) are equipped with an digital triple-axis accelerometer (3-DOF)
which measures the acceleration of the three directions (X, Y, Z). With an algorithm parsing the values in the background
steps can be detected on a specific pattern. The accuracy of detection mostly depends on a good algorithm. Some
trackers additionally use multiple sensors such as an accelerometer and a gyroscope (6-DOF or even more) for precise

determination on the hardware side
You can find plenty information about accelerometers on the internet (if you're interested in this topic)
Commercial trackers

There are many commercial activity trackers on the market to choose from. The following list gives a rough overview of

Analyzing and Running binaries from Firmware Images - Part 1

During the first part of SIMET Box Firmware analysis, we downloaded the firmware
Image, extracted its contents, compared/analyzed its base and found a couple of
interesting files (SSH keys, binary files, init scripts, firewall rules and so on).

For this part we'll focus on identifying binaries, comparing and executing them to find
interesting data. Whenever you're analyzing binaries from different architectures, there
are a couple of nice tools that aid debugging, reversing and emulating their behavior,
like objdump, readelf and QEMU.

Embedded Debian Project provides pre-built binary toolchains for mips, mipsel, arm,
armel, powerpc, and a couple of other architectures. In order to download and install it
on Debian based Linux distros, you have to apt-get its archive signing key:

 

Bee apt-get install emdebian-archive-keyring

 

Now you you need to include their repository on your /etc/apt/sources.list:

 

Bee http://www. emdebian.org/debian/ squeeze main

 

After the apt-get update you can install binutils for you target archs:

The Ultimate CPU emulator

Unicorn & QEMU

Unicorn engine is based QEMU, a great open source software emulator. Find more about
the techinical details of Unicorn in our Blackhat USA 2015 slides.

A notable difference between Unicorn and QEMU is that we only focus on emulating CPU
operations, but do not handle other parts of computer machine like QEMU. Internally,
Unicorn reuses the CPU emulation component of QEMU as its core (with quite a lot of
changes to adapt to our design). Therefore, our engine is able to emulate all the
instructions that QEMU can, but beyond that we can do more & do better in many aspects.

The section below highlights the areas where Unicorn shines.

¢ Framework: QEMU is a set of emulators, but not a framework. Therefore, you cannot
build your own tools on top of QEMU, while this is the main purpose of Unicorn.

¢ Flexible: QEMU cannot emulate a chunk of raw binary code without any context: it
requires either a proper executable binary (for example, a file in ELF format), or a
whole system image with a full OS inside. Meanwhile, Unicorn just focuses on CPU
operations, and can emulate raw code without context (see this tutorial).

¢ Instrumentation: QEMU does not support dynamic instrumentation, but with Unicorn
you can register customized handlers for various kind of events from CPU execution to
memory access. This feature gives tool programmers all the power they need to

1. Introduction

For some years now the world of IoT (Internet of Things) has experienced a
strong increase in the production of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices.
This type of “smart devices” changes the way we interact with the world,
but is often controlled through smartphone apps or software whose applica-
tion protocol is not disclosed.

This guide deals with the activity related to the reverse-engineering of the
protocol used in the communication with a BLE device.

It tries to be as general as possible, however it takes as a test/reference de-
vice the Eqiva radiator valves produced by the EQ3 company and the re-
lated Android application CalorBT . Between 2015 and 2016, Dr. Andrea
Trentini contacted the company more than once in order to obtain docu-
mentation related to the protocol, but the company did not want to provide
details. EQ3 also specified that there is no GNU/Linux software to interact
with the valves.

@ Guitaume Lesniak Jan 4,2019 - 4 min read ona

I consider myself a grey hat. I’m far from being the best hacker or cracker in
this world, and I tend to notify most of the people I “hack” about their
systems weaknesses. Almost all the “hacks” I am doing involve using some
software other people built: Slowloris test tools, SQLmap, and just
randomness/luck (like finding out where my ex-university stores everyone’s
cookies, or just trying random stuff on APIs).

Yes, I am closer to a script-kiddie than a hacker. However, for the first time
ever, today, I felt like I leveled-up my skills.

Sniffing and decoding NRF24L01+ and Bluetooth LE packets for under $30

In this long post | am going to describe my Journey to sniff and decode popular digital wireless protocols off the air for very cheap. So
cheap practicality anyone can obtain the equipment quickly.

I was able to decode NRF24L01+ and Bluetooth Low Energy protocols using RTL-SDR.

As far as | can see, this Is the first time the NRF24L01+ is being decoded, especially considering the low entry price for the hardware.
Given the extreme popularity of this transceiver, we are likely to see a wave of hackers attacking the security of many wireless
gadgets, and they are likely to succeed as security Is usually the last priority for hardware designers of such cheap gadgets.

Alot of work have been done to decode bluetooth using dedicated hardware and | am sure this software can be adapted to output the
right format as input to the existing Bluetooth decoders such as Wireshark.
As far as | can see, this is also the first time BTLE can be decoded using a very cheap generic device.

The main software repository for this project is at https://github.com/omrilluz/NRF24-BTLE-Decoder

Developing a wireless mesh network challenges

Recently I've been working on a project to create a super cheap (<$5) sensor node that can be flexible and power efficient so | can just
leave sensors everywhere and need absolutely no maintenance.

| decided to use the extremely popular NRF24L01* transceiver from Nordics Semiconductor due to a balance of performance, power
and price - and youl be surprised how many hardware designers have taken the exact same decision once you start sniffing the air for
packets. In my home alone | can see 15 addresses - wireless keyboards and mouse, remote controls, toys and appliances all use this
tiny transceiver for wireless communication.

‘While working on the mesh network code, my progress slowed to nearly a
halt. The code Is extremely complex and depends on external conditions
like signal strength, noise, etc. But worst of all? | was completely blind on
what really happens once packets leave the safely of my micro controller
using SPI to the transceiver. For normal (/.¢. non-wireless) projects I'm
